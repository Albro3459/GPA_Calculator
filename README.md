This is an Excel Sheet I created for the LSU Office of Admissions to accurately calculate GPAs across multiple different GPA scales. LSU receives thousands of applications from high schools that use completely different GPA scales and grade weighting. Part of my job was to create this Excel Sheet to standardize the calculations for Admissions Counselors. This excel sheet is used by Counselors at LSU to calculate GPAs accurately.

How to Use:
This Sheet comes protected, so that input can only be entered in the green cells; however, the password is shown to unprotect the sheet to view the code, formulas, and math behind the sheet. This calculator can handle grading scales such as the typical 4.0 and 100 point scales, along with 5 point, 6 point and any other type I have seen. The scales and weights are editable, since certain high schools weight differently. This sheet was created for ease of access for the counselors. When the sheet is locked, it is easy to tab through and enter grades, credit, and weight in an efficient manner. Credit defaults to 1, since the most common credit for high school transcripts is 1. The default is changeable in the "Credit: " cell, but resets back to 1, when "Clear" is clicked. Also nothing is case sensitive. I filled in both of the sheets with 2 different examples of grading scales. There are 4.0 and 100.0 buttons to default to those grading scales, but custom scales can also be used by changing the green cells.
